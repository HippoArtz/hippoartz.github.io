| Drenched in Silence | <img src="Resize1/drenched.jpg" alt="A curled figure drenched in rain; tears merge with water." width="400" /> | Folded in on herself, she is drenched so deep in sorrow tears and rain are indistinguishable. Vulnerability drips across her form, but there is strength in the stillness. This painting reflects grief that does not scream yet reshapes the body it inhabits. |

| Silenced Patriot | <img src="Resize1/flaggag.jpg" alt="Stripes forced between lips; eyes steady and bright." width="400" /> | The stars and stripes are used to bind and gag her. Her tears escape unnoticed, but her eyes burn with fire. Silence is its own violence and she endures its weight |
| Bloom Through the Break | <img src="Resize1/flowergirl.jpg" alt="A face split open with flowers blooming from within." width="400" /> | Pain blossoms into a garden that insists on being seen. |
| Oasis | <img src="Resize1/flowerpour.jpg" alt="A body formed as a cascading waterfall crowned with a bloom." width="400" /> | A body becomes the landscape—vacation as return to the elemental. |

| Burden of Many Faces | <img src="Resize1/masks.jpg" alt="A headless woman carrying multiple heads; masks slipping, identities exposed." width="400" /> | She shoulders the weight of her many selves. Each face is a shield, each mask a silence. The illusion fractures under the immense pressure. The masks slip and she stands exposed, unguarded, naked |
| Bloom Through the Break | <img src="Resize1/migraine.jpg" alt="Face deconstructed, flowers blossoming" width="400" /> | She splits herself wide, tearing away the pieces that bind. From the wounds blooms force their way through. The blooms are vivid, unyielding, each petal is beauty and strength. Pain blossoms into a garden that insists on being seen. |

| Crowned by Death | <img src="Resize1/proud.jpg" alt="Profile with red, white, and blue curls; a hooded shadow behind." width="400" /> | Her wild curls, streaked in red, white and blue are a glorious crown and a ghastly shroud. She ignores the hooded shadow- the silent witness. Though consumed by the drapings of this country, she stands proud, shoulders back head high, unbowed. |

| Skyline Escape | <img src="Resize1/remake.jpg" alt="A woman perched on a rooftop edge, reshaping the skyline." width="400" /> | She doesn’t leave the world; she rewrites it. |
| Shackled in Depths | <img src="Resize1/shackled.jpg" alt="A figure reaching upward as water closes in; a struggle to rise." width="400" /> | She fights her demons. A flailing hand breaks the surface, twisting capture into resistance. Drowning becomes survival. Defiance is survival even under the weight of herstory  and her future |
| Distraught | <img src="Resize1/sob.jpg" alt="A woman perches on her toes, spine bent she is folded in on herself. She is drenched in rain and tears fall from her eyes indistinguishable from the water falling from the sky" width="400" /> | Shedding tears, cloaked in rain |

| Strings of Control | <img src="Resize1/unshelved.jpg" alt="A giant hand presses a figure downward; motion restrained." width="400" /> | Unshelved, paralyzed, limp- she falls. She tumbles into the depths as an unnatural force sustains her descent. With each passing moment, her voice, her agency and her strength peel away. In the end she is a shell of herself, a puppet with her strings cut. |
